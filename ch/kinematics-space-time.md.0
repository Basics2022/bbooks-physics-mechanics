# Space and time
Classical mechanics relies on the concepts of **absolute 3-dimensional Euclidean space**, $E^3$, and **absolute time**.

Briefly, what is space? It's something you can measure with ruler (for distances) and square (for angles), or other space-measurment devices. 
What is time? It's something you can measure with a clock or other timekeeping devices.
