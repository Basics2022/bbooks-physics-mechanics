# Models
Different models of physical systems can be derived with an abstraction and modelling process, depending on the characteristics of the system under investigation and on the level of detail required by the analysis.

These models can be classified by:
- dimensions: 0: point; 1: line; 2: surfaces; 3: volume solid
- deformation: deformable or rigid components

A system can be composed of several components, either free or connected with constraints.

Here, the focus goes to the kinematics of [points](classical-mechanics:kinematics:point) and [rigid bodies](classical-mechanics:kinematics:rigid-body), while deformable bodies are described in [continuous mechanics](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-physics-continuum-mechanics/intro.html) - [kinematics](https://basics2022.github.io/bbooks-physics-continuum-mechanics/ch/continuum/kinematics.html).

While space and time are absolute, the motion of a system is usually the **motion relative to an observer** or to a reference frame. After treating the kinematics of points and rigid bodies w.r.t. a given reference frame, [relative kinematics](classical-mechanics:kinematics:relative) provides the description of the motion of the same system w.r.t. 2 different observers/reference frames in relative motion.
