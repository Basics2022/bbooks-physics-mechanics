### Universal Law of Gravitation
The force $\vec{F}_{12}$ exerted by a mass $m_2$ at $P_2$ on a mass $m_1$ at $P_1$ is described by **Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation**,

$$\vec{F}_{12} = G \, m_1 \, m_2 \dfrac{P_2 - P_1}{|P_2 - P_1|^3} \ ,$$

or

$$\vec{F}_{12} = G \, m_1 \, m_2 \dfrac{\hat{r}_{12}}{|\vec{r}_{12}|^2} \ ,$$

where $\vec{r}_{12} = (P_2 - P_1)$ is the vector pointing from point $P_1$ to point $P_2$, $r_{12} = |\vec{r}_{12}|$ is its magnitude, and $\hat{r}_{12} = \frac{\vec{r}_{12}}{|\vec{r}_{12}|}$ is the unit vector in the same direction. The **universal gravitational constant** $G$ is 

$$G = 6.67 \cdot 10^{-11} \frac{N \, m^2}{kg^2}$$ 

and is considered a constant of nature.

**Principle of Superposition of Causes and Effects (PSCE).** Principle of superposition holds, i.e. the force acting on a mass $m$ placed in $P$ due to a set of $N$ masses $\{ m_k \}_{k=1:N}$ placed in $P_k$ is the sum of individual forces $\vec{F}_{k}$,

$$\vec{F} = \sum_{k=1}^N \vec{F}_{k} = G \, m \, \sum_{k=1}^N m_k \dfrac{P_k - P}{|P_k - P|^3} \ .$$ (eq:gravitation:force:psce)

### Gravitational Field
The gravitational field generated by a set of masses $\{ m_k \}_{k=1:N}$ located at $P_k$ is a vector field associating a vector with physical dimensions $\frac{\text{[force]}}{\text{[mass]}}$ to each point in space $P$, that can be thought as the force per unit-mass acting on a **test mass** $m$ placed in $P$, whose expression directly follows from {eq}`eq:gravitation:force:psce`

$$\vec{g}(P) = \dfrac{\vec{F}}{m} = G \, \sum_{k=1}^N m_k \dfrac{P_k - P}{|P_k - P|^3} \ .$$

Given the gravitational field $\vec{g}(P)$, the gravitational force experienced by a system of mass $m$ at $P$ can be written as

  $$\vec{F}_g = m \vec{g}(P)$$

**Gravitational Potential Energy.** Gravitational potential of a system of 2 masses reads

$$V(P) = - G \, m \, m_1 \frac{1}{|P - P_1|} \ ,$$

as it can be easily shown evaluating its gradient,

$$\begin{aligned}
  \nabla V(P)
  & = - G \, m \, m_1 \, \hat{x}_k \, \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_k} \dfrac{1}{|P - P_1|} = \\
  & = - G \, m \, m_1 \, \hat{x}_k \, \left( - \dfrac{1}{|P - P_1|^2} \right) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_k} |P - P_1| = \\
  & =   G \, m \, m_1 \, \hat{x}_k \, \left(   \dfrac{1}{|P - P_1|^2} \right) \dfrac{x_k - x_{1,k}}{|P - P_1|} = \\
  & =   G \, m \, m_1 \, \dfrac{x_k - x_{1,k}}{|P - P_1|^3}  \, \hat{x}_k= \\
  & =   G \, m \, m_1 \, \dfrac{P-P_1}{|P - P_1|^3} \ .
\end{aligned}$$

Potential energy stored in a system of $N$ point masses $\{ m_k \}_{k=1:N}$ coincides with the work needed to build the system - a common choice to set the arbitrary additional constant of the energy is setting it equal to zero when masses are at infinite distances -, namely

$$V(P_k) = \sum_{\{i,k\}, i \ne k} G \, m_i \, m_k \frac{1}{|P_i - P_k|} \ ,$$

summing over different unordered pairs, i.e. $\{ 1, 2 \}$ and $\{2,1\}$ are the same pair and thus considered only once, or

$$V(P_k) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(i,k),  i\ne k} G \, m_i \, m_k \frac{1}{|P_i - P_k|} \ ,$$

summing over different ordered pairs, i.e. $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ are different pairs.



### Gravitational Field Near Earth's Surface
Within a limited domain near Earth's surface, it is common to approximate Earth's gravitational field as a uniform field, directed along the local vertical toward the center of the Earth, with intensity $g = G \frac{M_E}{R_E^2}$.

This model can be derived by approximating the position vector relative to the Earth's center $P - P_E \sim R_E \hat{r}$ and the unit vector identifying the direction from a point in the domain to the Earth's center with the local vertical $\hat{r}_{12} \sim - \hat{z}$,

$$\vec{g}(\vec{r}) = - G \dfrac{M_E}{R_E^2} \hat{z} = - g \hat{z} \ .$$

The gravitational force experienced by a body of mass $m$ near Earth's surface is thus 

$$\vec{F}_g = - m g \hat{z} \ ,$$

commonly referred to as **weight**.

**Gravitational Potential Energy.** It can be shown that the gravitational potential near Earth's surface becomes

$$V(P) = m \, g \, z_P \ .$$

```{dropdown} Proof.
With the series expansion, with $P - P_E = R_E \hat{r} + \vec{d}$, and $|\vec{d}| \ll R_E$,

$$\begin{aligned}
  V(P) & = - G \, m \, M_E \frac{1}{|P - P_E|} = \\
       & \approx G M_E \, m \left[ - \frac{1}{R_E} + \frac{R_E \hat{r} \cdot \vec{d}}{R_E^3}  \right]   = \\
       & = \underbrace{- m \, \frac{ G M_E}{R_E}}_{\text{const}} + m \, \underbrace{\frac{G \, M_E}{R_E^2}}_{= g} \underbrace{\hat{r} \cdot \vec{d}}_{= z}
\end{aligned}$$
```

## Elastic Actions: Linear Springs

According to Hooke's law, the behavior of an ideal linear elastic spring is described by the constitutive equation

$$F = k (\ell - \ell_0) \ ,$$

where $F$ is the absolute value of the force transmitted by the spring, $k$ is the spring constant, $\ell_0$ is the spring's rest length, and $\ell$ is the length in the considered configuration.

**Potential Energy.** 

The elemental work done by the spring is given by

$$\delta W =  F d \ell = k (\ell - \ell_0) d \ell.$$

Integrating this from $\ell_1$ to $\ell_2$, we get

$$W = \int_{\ell_1}^{\ell_2} k (\ell - \ell_0) d \ell = \left[ \frac{1}{2} k \ell^2 - k \ell_0 \, \ell \right]\bigg|_{\ell_1}^{\ell_2}.$$

The potential energy stored in the spring is 

$$V = \frac{1}{2} k (\ell - \ell_0)^2.$$ 

This energy represents the work done to stretch or compress the spring from its rest position.
