# Particular Motions

In this section, we will study certain particular motions that are interesting and useful to analyze for educational, historical, and practical reasons.

- Uniform rectilinear motion
- Uniformly accelerated motion
- Uniform circular motion
- Oscillatory and damped oscillatory motions:
  - Free oscillations:
    - Mass-spring(-damper) system
    - Pendulum
  - Forced oscillations:
    - A first step towards structural analysis and beyond ("every physical system is a system of many harmonic oscillators")
    - Concepts of frequency response and resonance. **todo** video and/or script on frequency response of structures and seismic structures, mass-damper,...
- **Gravitation**: Starting from Newton's universal law of gravitation, we study the motion of celestial bodies in two-body systems, discovering that their trajectories describe conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola), and demonstrating Kepler's laws.
- Rotation of a body around a fixed point, Poinsot's motions
