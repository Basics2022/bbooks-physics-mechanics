# Principles of Newtonian Mechanics

**First Principle of Dynamics (Newton's First Law): inertia and Galileian invariance.** A body (more precisely, the center of mass of a body) on which no net force acts remains in its state of rest or uniform rectilinear motion relative to an inertial reference frame.

**todo** discuss the role/definition of **inertial reference frames** in classical mechanics and **Galileian invariance** (equations of motions are invariant under Galileian transformations)

**Second Principle of Dynamics (Newton's Second Law): momentum balance.** Relative to an inertial reference frame, the change in momentum of a system is equal to the impulse of the external forces acting on it,

$$\Delta \vec{Q} = \vec{I}^e \ .$$

In the case of smooth motion, where the momentum can be represented as a continuous and differentiable function of time, the second principle of dynamics can be expressed in differential form,

$$\dot{\vec{Q}} = \vec{R}^e \ ,$$

where the resultant of the external forces, $\vec{R}^e = \frac{d \vec{I}^e}{dt}$, is the time derivative of the impulse.

**Third Principle of Dynamics (Newton's Third Law): action-reaction.** If a system $i$ exerts a force $\vec{F}_{ji}$ on a system $j$, then system $j$ exerts an "equal and opposite" force $\vec{F}_{ij}$ on system $i$, with equal magnitude and opposite direction,

$$\vec{F}_{ij} = - \vec{F}_{ji} \ .$$

## Inertial reference frame

Force sensors in an inertial reference frame measure only "true forces". But what's a "true force"? In classical mechanics, true forces are due to gravitational interactions and electromagnetic interactions. Electromangetic interactions between charged systems; electromangetic interactions between electrically neutral systems as contact forces...
