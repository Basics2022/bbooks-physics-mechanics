# Inertia

Inertia deals with mass and mass distribution of systems.

But what is mass? Mass is a physical quantity, property of the system, that manifests itself:
- in gravitational attraction (being both the origin of gravitational force and the property that makes a system sensible to gravitational attraction),
- in resistance to change of motion of a system under external [actions](classical-mechanics:dynamics), as it will be clear in [dynamics](classical-mechanics:dynamics)
